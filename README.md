# TCP-Centralized_Network
* Client Server Centralized Network
The following project is a TCP Client Server Network, which allows a client to connect to a server. Once the client is connected they receive a client id used to identify themselves on the server, as well as being given options such as: 1. seeing what other clients are on the server. 2. sending other clients a messages, 3. view messages sent to you from other clients, 4. create a new chat room, 5. join an existing chat room, and finally 6. disconnecting from the server.
* The following are external libraries that were used in this project: 1. socket, 2. pickle, 3. datetime, 4. threading.
* The version of Python3 that was used to create this project was Python 3.8, and I do not believe that there will be any complications with running this project on another machine.
